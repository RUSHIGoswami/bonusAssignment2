# Spiral Matrix

## Here I have uploaded solution of bonus assignment.

## Description

--> You are given size of matrix n you have to write a function to insert data into (n x n) matrix in spiral order.<br>
--> Write another function to print created matrix.<br>
--> Start filling data from 1 and keep on Incrementing.<br>

## Approach

--> My approach is to iterate matrix in circular way to fill data in repetitive way.<br>
--> For Directions I have taken 4 positions of martix which are four corners.<br>
--> Now to change directions we have to modify these four variables accordingly.<br>


--> Firstly, I have implemented my approach with simple 2D array.<br>
--> After which I have also implemented my approach with 2D List (Collections).<br>
